          * Due to COVID-19, we aren't able to host an overnight event this year, but don't worry â€” we will still offer an in-person experience.
          We've decided to host BlairHacks_5 in two portions: a virtual portion and an in-person portion.

        <Text mt={2}>
          The virtual portion will take place on Day 1 and will consist of a few virtual activities starting in the afternoon.
          The in-person portion will be on Day 2 at our facility.
          All attendees are required to attend both portions.
