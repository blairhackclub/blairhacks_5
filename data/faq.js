    question: "What is a hackathon?",
    answer: "A hackathon is a coding marathon where you create a ‘hack’ (programming solution) addressing a problem you see around you. The problem can be big or small, serious or comedic!"
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guys actually hack?",
    answer: "No, that's not what we mean by \"hack\"! Hacking is a general term for taking advantage of unintended aspects of systems. We apply hacking to situations in life and we create apps and programs that can solve modern, real world issues."
